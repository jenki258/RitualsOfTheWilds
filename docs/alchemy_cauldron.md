# 🧪 Alchemy Cauldron - Custom Recipes

The Alchemy Cauldron in **Rituals Of The Wilds** allows you to create powerful items or execute commands through custom recipes. There are **two types** of Alchemy Cauldron recipes:  
1. **Item-Giving Recipes** – Produces an item as a result.  
2. **Command-Execution Recipes** – Runs a command instead of giving an item.

## ⚠️ Important: Avoiding Game Crashes  

**Incorrect settings can cause the game to crash!**  
Make sure that when `"Execute Command Insted of Giving Item"` is set to `true`, all necessary command-related values are properly set.  

🚨 **Game will crash if:**  
❌ `"Execute Command Insted of Giving Item": true` but **values like `"Fixed or Random Amount"` are still used (which are for items only).**

❌ Somewhere was missed "," sign

❌ Somewhere was missed line of the template json(Even if it's an empty thing)

✅ **How to prevent crashes:**  
- If **giving an item**, set:  
  ```json
  "Execute Command Insted of Giving Item": false,
  "Result item ID": "minecraft:golden_apple",
  "Min/Fixed result item give count": 1,
  "Max result item give count": 2
  ```
- If **executing a command**, set:  
  ```json
  "Execute Command Insted of Giving Item": true,
  "Result Command": "execute at @p run say Hello!",
  "Min/Fixed result execution count": 1,
  "Max result execution count": 2
  ```

## 📂 Editing Existing Recipes  

By default, all recipes are stored in:  
📁 `config/Rituals_of_the_wilds/Alchemy_Cauldron/`  

### ⚠️ Preventing Recipe Reset  
If you modify an existing recipe but don't want it to reset back to default, you must **disable auto-regeneration** in the main config file:  

1. Open `config/Rituals_Of_The_Wilds.toml`  
2. Find this setting:  
   ```toml
   "Auto Regenerate Alchemy Cauldron recipes" = true
   ```  
3. Change it to `false`:  
   ```toml
   "Auto Regenerate Alchemy Cauldron recipes" = false
   ```
4. **No restart is needed!** The setting takes effect immediately.

## 📜 Creating a New Recipe  

To add a new Alchemy Cauldron recipe:  

1. Go to **`config/Rituals_of_the_wilds/Alchemy_Cauldron/`**  
2. Create a new file with a **numbered filename** (e.g., `4alchemyrecipe.json`).  
   - The number **must be 500 or lower**.  
   - The number **must be the next available number** (e.g., if the highest number is `3alchemyrecipe.json`, name your file `4alchemyrecipe.json`).

## 🔹 Item-Giving Recipe Format  

An **Item-Giving Recipe** will return an item when the correct ingredients are used.  

### 📝 Example [Item-Giving Recipe](config/Rituals_of_the_wilds/Alchemy_Cauldron/1alchemyrecipe.json)

---

## 🔹 Command-Execution Recipe Format  

Instead of giving an item, this recipe **executes a command** when the correct ingredients are used.  

### 📝 Example [Command-Execution Recipe](config/Rituals_of_the_wilds/Alchemy_Cauldron/2alchemyrecipe.json)

### **Summary of Key Fields**

---

- **`"Moon Stage Needed": false`** → **Whether a specific moon stage is required** for the ritual. If `true`, the ritual only works on certain moon phases.
  
- **`"Moon Stage": 0`** → **Specifies which moon phase is required** (0 represents the full moon, following the exact Minecraft moon phases without the +1 offset).

- **`"Runes on cauldron needed": false`** → **Checks if the cauldron has special runes applied to it**, marking it as a "coated" cauldron. If `true`, the ritual requires the cauldron to be in this special state.

- **`"Cauldron Fill Type": 0`** → Defines the **type of filling in the cauldron**:
  - `0`: Empty
  - `1`: Water
  - `2`: Lava
  
- **`"Check for blocks around": false`** → **Checks the surrounding blocks** to see if specific conditions are met (e.g., special structures, runes, etc.) in the area around the cauldron.

- **`"Remove blocks when used": false`** → **Determines whether blocks should be removed** when the ritual is performed. 
  - If `true`, the blocks are replaced or cleared according to the block replacement rules.

- **`"Block X-3 ID Or Tag": ""`** → **Defines a block ID or tag** at the relative position X-3 that must be present for the ritual to succeed.

- **`"Block X+3 ID Or Tag": ""`** → Similar to the previous block, but checks at position X+3. Used to verify specific blocks in the surrounding area.

- **`"Replacement Block X-3 ID": ""`** → **Specifies the block** that will replace the one at position X-3 if the ritual condition is met.

- **`"Ingredient ID or Tag 1" to "Ingredient ID or Tag 10"`** → **Lists the required ingredients** for the ritual, in a specific order. The ingredients **must be placed in the exact order** with no gaps, from 1 to 10.

- **`"Execute Command Instead of Giving Item": true`** → **Ensures the cauldron runs a command** instead of returning an item. If `true`, the ritual will trigger a command execution instead of giving the player a result item.

- **`"Execute as player"`** → If `true`, the command will execute **as the player**, allowing player-specific coordinates and actions. If `false`, the command will execute at the block or world level (not as a player).

- **`"Result Command"`** → **Specifies the command** that will run when the recipe is used. For example, this could be something like `summon lightning` or any other command.

- **`"Min/Fixed result execution count"` & `"Max result execution count"`** → **Defines how many times the command will execute**. The count can range from a fixed value to a random amount, depending on the settings.

- **`"Check for Blocks +2Y(Only works with Check for blocks around true)": false`** → If `true`, checks for blocks **2 blocks above the cauldron** (Y+2) in addition to the standard checks around the cauldron. Only works if `Check for blocks around` is `true`.

- **`"Remove upper blocks when used": false`** → If `true`, it removes blocks **above the cauldron** when the ritual is executed (similar to how the "Remove blocks when used" works).

- **`"Block X-3 Y+2 ID Or Tag" to "Replacement Block X-2 Y+2 Z-2 ID"`** → These fields allow checking and replacing **upper blocks** (Y+2), which are positioned above the cauldron, based on their IDs or tags.

- **`"Min/Fixed result item give count"` & `"Max result item give count"`** → **Defines the number of items** the ritual will return (between the minimum and maximum values).

## ✅ Summary  

- **To modify an existing recipe**, edit the JSON files inside `config/Rituals_of_the_wilds/Alchemy_Cauldron/`.  
- **To prevent recipe resets**, turn off `"Auto Regenerate Alchemy Cauldron recipes"` in the `toml` config file.  
- **To add a new recipe**, create a new numbered JSON file (`Xalchemyrecipe.json`).  
- **Choose between giving an item or executing a command** by setting `"Execute Command Insted of Giving Item"` to `true` or `false`.  
- **Check settings carefully** to avoid crashes when making command-based recipes!  

🚀 **Now you’re ready to customize the Alchemy Cauldron to your liking!**  
```
