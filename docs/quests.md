# 🧭 Quest System - Rituals Of The Wilds

This document describes how to configure **Quest JSON files** for the *Rituals of the Wilds* mod. Quests are used to create task-based progression, including item delivery, entity interactions, and combat challenges.

---

## 📁 File Location

Quest files must be placed in:

```

/config/Rituals_of_the_wilds/quests/eng/

````

> ✅ **Important:** Use **long and unique filenames**. Short names may conflict (e.g., `"long.json"` and `"on.json"`), causing false-positive completions.

---

## 🧩 Supported Quest Types

| Type | Description                          |
|------|--------------------------------------|
| `1`  | **Give item to quest giver**         |
| `2`  | **Deliver item to another entity**   |
| `3`  | **Kill a specific entity**           |

> ❗ **Never modify the `Quest Type` after creation** — doing so will crash the game.

---
